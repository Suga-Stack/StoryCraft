Place the first-scene background image here with the exact filename:

scene1.jpg

Notes:
- This folder is served statically by Vite/Capacitor. Access path in code: `/images/scene1.jpg`.
- You can use .png or .webp too, but keep the filename `scene1.jpg` unless you update the code in `src/views/GamePage.vue`.
